Objective: Shoot at enemies and don't let them hit you

Controls:

W A S D / Left controller joystick - Move.
Arrow keys / Right controller joystick - Shoot.
Mouse 1 / Left mouse button - Select options.

Collision with enemy causes player to take damage and eventually die.

Game currently is over after 1 death because I could not get a life counter to work.

I have personally done the tutorials from 1 - 21 and after that have added the rudimentary start and end screens to the game.
